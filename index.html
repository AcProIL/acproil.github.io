                    <p>Peano’s Interlingua (also known as <em>Latino sine flexione</em>: latin without inflexions) is a
                        language constructed by Giuseppe Peano at the beginning of the last century. This
                        <strong>simplified Latin</strong> is designed to be a neutral and practical instrument for
                        international cooperation, firstly in the academic sphere.</p>
                    <p>After a short grammar study, everyone can learn to compose in this language using only an
                        Interlingua (or Latin) dictionary.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>The need for an auxiliary language for international relations in the field of science,
                            commerce, etc., is obvious. Any national language presents a multitude of unnecessary
                            complications, the mastery of which requires several years of study. Descartes, Leibnitz and
                            several other philosophers have studied the question of a rational language, simpler and
                            more logical than natural languages. At that time, Latin was in international use; but
                            during the past century, the use of national languages in place of Latin, and the
                            strengthening of international relations, has made the problem of international language
                            more urgent.</p>

                        or as standalone academic publications (see <a

                        found in libraries. We must also mention the <em>Formulario Mathematico</em>, which was a
