The aim of this site is to present and give tools to master and spread the
conlang created by Giuseppe Peano: Latino sine flexione.

## Contribute to dictionaries

In order to contribute to the dictionaries, you just need to edit the
`dicts/xxx-lsf.json` files. It should be quite staightforward.
The reciprocal dictionary is automatically generated by a Python script.

### Add a new language

1. Create the `dicts/xxx-lsf.json` file.
2. Add `xxx` to the options of the two `select` in `dictionary.html`.
3. Add `xxx` to the languages list in `dicts/reverse.py`.
